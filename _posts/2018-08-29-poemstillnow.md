Do you know you
Yes you a mere concept of my mind using which I make stories about you
Sorry was it loud that you understand yourself
Well let me try again please
Reader reading reader
Are you a riddle so why do you look puzzled if you are riddle then be riddle don't pretend to be puzzled being puzzled is just a feeling reader 
Be a riddle the way you are

Is it my thinking that shows you as different. you just exist in my mind. I have captured you and now I will rule you using my stories ,my words . Do you feel strained  inside me or after read you are strained inside the dog ma of my straining beliefs.

Oh you look puzzled don't be puzzled you are just riddle for me I can hear your beautiful voice amused,.making story about me making me your you.
How dare you to make me strained  you are nothing but a reader don't even try to capture me

One second are We all captured along inside

It's just me captured me to become another me which you deserve
Oh do you know this way you will destroy me without knowing me.

Don't make me your you
Make me pastless me.

well hell with the smile 
hell wth the people who  wishes when stars brake
hell with the light which attracts bugs to kill
hell all over the dreams which keeps you waiting to be real
hell with the morals which burns you till you become
hell with the past that keeps you thinking
slide the curtains .GO NOW
,,,,,,,,,,,,still saving for future

there is sequence that my heart follows 
and a dream that you exist

## 4

A thing if I write about it
Then I have totally lost it
If I stare deep into thing
It shows me mirror back
I don't remember I feel it
I can't count it but I keep it
It doesn't appear on chair
It flows through grass
And ends when thought

Kind of funny I zoom in and disappear 
 
Solved it and resolved it and found was the question in wrapper of answer
Air in hair and flow of dim light connects it
Feels strange that I had it and thoughts began to oppose

A mystery  that kept us lightening and kept bright 
Don't know without the mystery of tomorrow would I live

## 5

I go blind cause here isn't where I imagine to be
Satisfaction feels like delusional
 memory
All the heartaches are echoes of sweet death 
Yes not whole not perfect
Calm but imperfectly perfect
I am melody that scares 
Guess what Lust you hide ,exist 
Not enough not fine  
Halt , I begin 

## 6

Do you know what's alive and breathing ?
My hopes to be with you 
Don't know what world thinks about theory of reality
I feel this electrons displaying my poem for you,it means something real

## 7

the sadness of king
The madness of dreams 
and old gone heartaches
would you come up to feel
would you bring up the dream

## 8

Sometimes staring at window in dark becomes a poem
Sometimes life becomes a stranger to present 
Sometimes meaning falls from words of the blind
Yeah sometimes I want you sometimes 
Cause candle Still lives when there’s light
Cause heart still comes at left
How come we ignore the heart isn’t right
We imagine , we live
We lie we make
Words blur words
Oh world you are half beauty cause full doesn’t provide the curious being a life.

## 9

Smile is fool’s defect
Cause I dive in sky 
To live tonight
Adios , I’m fool tonight
I am I who understands I on behalf of I 
Swear that I will be I 
Adios,I’m fool tonight 

## 10

It’s maybe,yeah it’s maybe
That a poem will go on....
Firestone scratched inside maybe
Dreams of better sunrise maybe
Your hands in my hair to wake me maybe
Slow tunes in deaf mind yeah it is
My may be spread away when you smile by
Yeah yes it is ,yeah yes it is
That a poem will go on

## 11

You won’t feel a thing
Yeah you won’t 
Coldness sparking a body
Lies of circles of infinity 
Dreams hanging in eyes
Do you? I think you don’t 
Castles of work and
Shortcuts to drowning 
Has broke you in odds
I am not kind of visionary or
Error free 
Just a fool in time trying to understand tears and smiles 
Who said there ‘s rule to follow 
Who said great people were happy as they arrived 
Who said I was one of them
So I cried today to see so I exist?
But quotes tangled me to be kept in world
I dream therefore I am
I follow my dream therefore I am

## 12

Don’t know how it struck me or how it drowns me
The water I swim in is not the water I dream in 
Understandings away cause
Infinity is the thing touched by finite me

Dream on swim on cause water you dream in is just ahead the water you swim in

## 13

What I feel now is trying to be poem
But it’s tiny headache tiny focus and tiny movement 
Will it grow to just flow
Like a dot to fill up dimension
Oh the poem well a poem
Crossed the arrow of structure
Well well a structure, a bunch of caged bakers of delight
Well well I know the path ,
If it is spelled incorrect.

## 14

Capture me
I am the fuzzy little feeling you seek
Capture me
Oh old lady you are waiting for it
Capture me
To ignite the fire in green 
Capture me 
At last cause I am the movement
Cause I am the movement 
You seek

## 15

Hold me tight don’t let me go it feels like victim without the law 
Slow and caging night to go
Hold me tight don’t let me go

To fly from mountain in the risky edge of wheel chair 
Don’t let me go or it will be me not anymore 

Conflicting dreams and naps of a night
Wake me up solve me now
Don’t you know dream we had
We fell from shyness and got struck into connections 
To float through our wounds
Come back , come back and hold me tight and don’t let me go

## 16

Then I realised 
Real eyes have not realised 
Me inside you
The samurai broke his sword to kill him inside
The pain now smiles inside his scars
Please come now please try to realise 
Man inside this armour screams loud

## 17

A thing if I write about it
I have totally lost it that second 
If I stare deep into the thing
It shows me mirror back
I don’t remember I feel it
I can’t count it but I keep it 
It doesn’t appear on chair 
It flows through grass 
And ends when thought 
Kind of funny I zoom in and disappear 

Solved it resolved it and found was the question in wrapper of answer

Air in hair and flow of dim light connects it

Feels strange that I had it and the thoughts began to oppose
A mystery that kept us lightening and kept bright 
Don’t know without the mystery of tomorrow would I live?

Situations tell you to fold the books
Close the eyes and die till your death

Situations complex mysteries changing locks like flying Squidish 

Ahh situations just the situations 
To the next move to the next page to the next heart I’m gonna move

To prove thesis are wrong, to prove lines are song, to prove I can define me, Slowly steadily bringing peace to my heart

To look into eyes of the past to crawl into dreams and sleep till my songs become reality till my shit become golden
Till I become I . Till I live in the centuries of all time 
Hoping this shit so cool to the next line to the next song I am gonna move

## 19

I’m feeling blue please dance around me
Like kid without Santa on Christmas 
Like in the line without the wind
Oceany blue like really really blue
On the edge of stool just to fall
Like a hard working husband on activa 
Who is just gonna crack up on the street 

So save me 
I am feeling blue please dance around me
Please let me fall into your hugs till death
Please let me explain how bloomed my soul would be
To fly with you to dream with you to be with you so start this with dancing around me

If you don’t then song will not have tune and writers gonna suck so it will be all the blue times

## 20

Left all things that desired me 
left all things that kept quiet on me
Just started walking
A bird flew away more then the eyes could see
More then the death could race
More then the dreams could follow 

The bird saw the clouds and felt the cry
The bird saw the light and fell asleep 
The bird felt urge of morning 
The bird felt urge of dying sun
The bird left the circle
Now where this weirdo will end up

Thats when I

Left all the things that desired me
Left all things that kept quiet on me
Just started walking
To become a bird who I am

## 21

I can feel this shadows near me 
Looking straight into my eyes 
Appear disappear appear disappear 
Scratching my feelings to make a tune in a slow song peace
Appear Disappear Appear Disappear
Glasses ,logics , surfaces
Can’t see ,explain or stand in 
Stopping my heart handshaking my soul
Hurts when I come back 
Appear Disappear Appear Disappear 
A bag full of spells ,magics,tricks
But still can’t figure out the math of killed me
Kind of awake Kind of hypnotised 
Appear Disappear Appear Disappear 
Eyes, Experiment, Fake smiles of understanding still not blur,not solved
Shadows Ahh Shadows Ahh
Gone me Gone me Gone me Gone me

## 22

Scratching the surface,falling from trees
Found the directions in the words
Where I am free
Less weight high hopes to hop through the holes
Another tree in another sea that has another dream but my gaze and look will make you believe 
That shadow you find in poem lives here underneath 
An animal inside is an animal outside 
So don’t know when or don’t know why
An animal hides behind the glasses to look solved 

Yup another tree in another sea that has another dream 
Half words half love
Half smile but full life

## 23

Careless mind is a drug
It’s high on the nodes of darkness 
You poke a bear and it stares you scream inside
But the bear is empty to be killer or pet
Careless mind is not a part of humanity
It’s eyes staring not to be emphasised 
Can you hear it or not 
Can you feel it or not
What’s real and what’s not real
All illusion in the effect of drug

## 24

All holdings are gone 
Awakening of concept 
Brings death to roses
But what if it’s all mirage
I’m finding my heart
But eyes are colourblind 
Tones are not speaking for themselves
I am slave to them
End your quotes cause
They are just empty invocations
Of feelings just like this one

## 25

I dream you exist
But my mind follows patterns to find you
A mirage really
Why memories exist backwards 
And we live forward 
Are you part of me or illusion
Lie may create you and let you exist
You crave for truth with same filter of lie
Who creates, who breaks,who lives,who dies
If I tell you ,you exist and if you think I don’t 
Then can this writing exist 
Existence is relative don’t you think?
Please think

## 26

Do you know what's alive and breathing ?
My hopes to be with you 
Don't know what world thinks about theory of reality
I feel this electrons displaying my poem for you, it means something real
