Do you know you
Yes you a mere concept of my mind using which I make stories about you
Sorry was it loud that you understand yourself
Well let me try again please
Reader reading reader
Are you a riddle so why do you look puzzled if you are riddle then be riddle don't pretend to be puzzled being puzzled is just a feeling reader 
Be a riddle the way you are

Is it my thinking that shows you as different. you just exist in my mind. I have captured you and now I will rule you using my stories ,my words . Do you feel strained  inside me or after read you are strained inside the dog ma of my straining beliefs.

Oh you look puzzled don't be puzzled you are just riddle for me I can hear your beautiful voice amused,.making story about me making me your you.
How dare you to make me strained  you are nothing but a reader don't even try to capture me

One second are We all captured along inside

It's just me captured me to become another me which you deserve
Oh do you know this way you will destroy me without knowing me.

Don't make me your you
Make me pastless me.

well hell with the smile 
hell wth the people who  wishes when stars brake
hell with the light which attracts bugs to kill
hell all over the dreams which keeps you waiting to be real
hell with the morals which burns you till you become
hell with the past that keeps you thinking
slide the curtains .GO NOW
,,,,,,,,,,,,still saving for future

there is sequence that my heart follows 
and a dream that you exist

A thing if I write about it
Then I have totally lost it
If I stare deep into thing
It shows me mirror back
I don't remember I feel it
I can't count it but I keep it
It doesn't appear on chair
It flows through grass
And ends when thought

Kind of funny I zoom in and disappear 
 
Solved it and resolved it and found was the question in wrapper of answer
Air in hair and flow of dim light connects it
Feels strange that I had it and thoughts began to oppose

A mystery  that kept us lightening and kept bright 
Don't know without the mystery of tomorrow would I live

I go blind cause here isn't where I imagine to be
Satisfaction feels like delusional
 memory
All the heartaches are echoes of sweet death 
Yes not whole not perfect
Calm but imperfectly perfect
I am melody that scares 
Guess what Lust you hide ,exist 
Not enough not fine  
Halt , I begin

Do you know what's alive and breathing ?
My hopes to be with you 
Don't know what world thinks about theory of reality
I feel this electrons displaying my poem for you,it means something real

the sadness of king
The madness of dreams 
and old gone heartaches
would you come up to feel
would you bring up the dream
