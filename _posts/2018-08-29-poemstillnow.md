Do you know you <br>
Yes you a mere concept of my mind using which I make stories about you<br>
Sorry was it loud that you understand yourself<br>
Well let me try again please<br>
Reader reading reader<br>
Are you a riddle so why do you look puzzled if you are riddle then be riddle don't pretend to be puzzled <br>being puzzled is just a feeling reader <br>
Be a riddle the way you are<br>

Is it my thinking that shows you as different. you just exist in my mind. I have captured you and now I will<br> rule you using my stories ,my words . Do you feel strained  inside me or after read you are strained <br>inside the dog ma of my straining beliefs.<br>

Oh you look puzzled don't be puzzled you are just riddle for me I can hear your beautiful voice <br>amused,.making story about me making me your you.<br>
How dare you to make me strained  you are nothing but a reader don't even try to capture me<br>

One second are We all captured along inside<br>

It's just me captured me to become another me which you deserve<br>
Oh do you know this way you will destroy me without knowing me.<br>

Don't make me your you<br>
Make me pastless me.<br>

well hell with the smile <br>
hell wth the people who  wishes when stars brake<br>
hell with the light which attracts bugs to kill<br>
hell all over the dreams which keeps you waiting to be real<br>
hell with the morals which burns you till you become<br>
hell with the past that keeps you thinking<br>
slide the curtains .GO NOW<br>
,,,,,,,,,,,,still saving for future  <br>

## 3

there is sequence that my heart follows <br>
and a dream that you exist<br>

## 4

A thing if I write about it<br>
Then I have totally lost it<br>
If I stare deep into thing<br>
It shows me mirror back<br>
I don't remember I feel it<br>
I can't count it but I keep it<br>
It doesn't appear on chair<br>
It flows through grass<br>
And ends when thought<br>

Kind of funny I zoom in and disappear <br>
 
Solved it and resolved it and found was the question in wrapper of answer<br>
Air in hair and flow of dim light connects it<br>
Feels strange that I had it and thoughts began to oppose<br>

A mystery  that kept us lightening and kept bright <br>
Don't know without the mystery of tomorrow would I live<br>

## 5

I go blind cause here isn't where I imagine to be<br>
Satisfaction feels like delusional
 memory<br>
All the heartaches are echoes of sweet death <br>
Yes not whole not perfect<br>
Calm but imperfectly perfect<br>
I am melody that scares <br>
Guess what Lust you hide ,exist<br> 
Not enough not fine  <br>
Halt , I begin <br>

## 6

Do you know what's alive and breathing ?<br>
My hopes to be with you <br>
Don't know what world thinks about theory of reality<br>
I feel this electrons displaying my poem for you,it means something real<br>

## 7

the sadness of king<br>
The madness of dreams <br>
and old gone heartaches<br>
would you come up to feel<br>
would you bring up the dream<br>

## 8

Sometimes staring at window in dark becomes a poem<br>
Sometimes life becomes a stranger to present <br>
Sometimes meaning falls from words of the blind<br>
Yeah sometimes I want you sometimes <br>
Cause candle Still lives when there’s light<br>
Cause heart still comes at left<br>
How come we ignore the heart isn’t right<br>
We imagine , we live<br>
We lie we make<br>
Words blur words<br>
Oh world you are half beauty cause full doesn’t provide the curious being a life.<br>

## 9

Smile is fool’s defect<br>
Cause I dive in sky <br>
To live tonight<br>
Adios , I’m fool tonight<br>
I am I who understands I on behalf of I <br>
Swear that I will be I <br>
Adios,I’m fool tonight <br>

## 10

It’s maybe,yeah it’s maybe<br>
That a poem will go on....<br>
Firestone scratched inside maybe<br>
Dreams of better sunrise maybe<br>
Your hands in my hair to wake me maybe<br>
Slow tunes in deaf mind yeah it is<br>
My may be spread away when you smile by<br>
Yeah yes it is ,yeah yes it is<br>
That a poem will go on<br>

## 11

You won’t feel a thing<br>
Yeah you won’t <br>
Coldness sparking a body<br>
Lies of circles of infinity <br>
Dreams hanging in eyes<br>
Do you? I think you don’t <br>
Castles of work and<br>
Shortcuts to drowning <br>
Has broke you in odds<br>
I am not kind of visionary or<br>
Error free <br>
Just a fool in time trying to understand tears and smiles <br>
Who said there ‘s rule to follow <br>
Who said great people were happy as they arrived <br>
Who said I was one of them<br>
So I cried today to see so I exist?<br>
But quotes tangled me to be kept in world<br>
I dream therefore I am<br>
I follow my dream therefore I am<br>

## 12

Don’t know how it struck me or how it drowns me<br>
The water I swim in is not the water I dream in <br>
Understandings away cause<br>
Infinity is the thing touched by finite me<br>

Dream on swim on cause water you dream in is just ahead the water you swim in<br>

## 13

What I feel now is trying to be poem<br>
But it’s tiny headache tiny focus and tiny movement<br> 
Will it grow to just flow<br>
Like a dot to fill up dimension<br>
Oh the poem well a poem<br>
Crossed the arrow of structure<br>
Well well a structure, a bunch of caged bakers of delight<br>
Well well I know the path ,<br>
If it is spelled incorrect.<br>

## 14

Capture me<br>
I am the fuzzy little feeling you seek<br>
Capture me<br>
Oh old lady you are waiting for it<br>
Capture me<br>
To ignite the fire in green <br>
Capture me <br>
At last cause I am the movement<br>
Cause I am the movement <br>
You seek<br>

## 15

Hold me tight don’t let me go it feels like victim without the law <br>
Slow and caging night to go<br>
Hold me tight don’t let me go<br>

To fly from mountain in the risky edge of wheel chair <br>
Don’t let me go or it will be me not anymore <br>

Conflicting dreams and naps of a night<br>
Wake me up solve me now<br>
Don’t you know dream we had<br>
We fell from shyness and got struck into connections <br>
To float through our wounds<br>
Come back , come back and hold me tight and don’t let me go<br>

## 16

Then I realised <br>
Real eyes have not realised <br>
Me inside you<br>
The samurai broke his sword to kill him inside<br>
The pain now smiles inside his scars<br>
Please come now please try to realise <br>
Man inside this armour screams loud<br>

## 17

A thing if I write about it<br>
I have totally lost it that second<br> 
If I stare deep into the thing<br>
It shows me mirror back<br>
I don’t remember I feel it<br>
I can’t count it but I keep it<br> 
It doesn’t appear on chair <br>
It flows through grass <br>
And ends when thought <br>
Kind of funny I zoom in and disappear<br> 

Solved it resolved it and found was the question in wrapper of answer<br>

Air in hair and flow of dim light connects it<br>

Feels strange that I had it and the thoughts began to oppose<br>
A mystery that kept us lightening and kept bright <br>
Don’t know without the mystery of tomorrow would I live?<br>

## 18

Situations tell you to fold the books<br>
Close the eyes and die till your death<br>

Situations complex mysteries changing locks like flying Squidish <br>

Ahh situations just the situations <br>
To the next move to the next page to the next heart I’m gonna move<br>

To prove thesis are wrong, to prove lines are song, to prove I can define me, Slowly steadily bringing peace to my heart<br>

To look into eyes of the past to crawl into dreams and sleep till my songs become reality till my shit become golden<br>
Till I become I . Till I live in the centuries of all time <br>
Hoping this shit so cool to the next line to the next song I am gonna move<br>

## 19

I’m feeling blue please dance around me<br>
Like kid without Santa on Christmas <br>
Like in the line without the wind<br>
Oceany blue like really really blue<br>
On the edge of stool just to fall<br>
Like a hard working husband on activa<br> 
Who is just gonna crack up on the street <br>

So save me <br>
I am feeling blue please dance around me<br>
Please let me fall into your hugs till death<br>
Please let me explain how bloomed my soul would be<br>
To fly with you to dream with you to be with you so start this with dancing around me<br>

If you don’t then song will not have tune and writers gonna suck so it will be all the blue times<br>

## 20

Left all things that desired me <br>
left all things that kept quiet on me<br>
Just started walking<br>
A bird flew away more then the eyes could see<br>
More then the death could race<br>
More then the dreams could follow <br>

The bird saw the clouds and felt the cry<br>
The bird saw the light and fell asleep <br>
The bird felt urge of morning <br>
The bird felt urge of dying sun<br>
The bird left the circle<br>
Now where this weirdo will end up<br>

Thats when I<br>

Left all the things that desired me<br>
Left all things that kept quiet on me<br>
Just started walking<br>
To become a bird who I am<br>

## 21

I can feel this shadows near me <br>
Looking straight into my eyes <br>
Appear disappear appear disappear <br>
Scratching my feelings to make a tune in a slow song peace<br>
Appear Disappear Appear Disappear<br>
Glasses ,logics , surfaces<br>
Can’t see ,explain or stand in<br> 
Stopping my heart handshaking my soul<br>
Hurts when I come back <br>
Appear Disappear Appear Disappear<br> 
A bag full of spells ,magics,tricks<br>
But still can’t figure out the math of killed me<br>
Kind of awake Kind of hypnotised <br>
Appear Disappear Appear Disappear <br>
Eyes, Experiment, Fake smiles of understanding still not blur,not solved<br>
Shadows Ahh Shadows Ahh<br>
Gone me Gone me Gone me Gone me<br>

## 22

Scratching the surface,falling from trees<br>
Found the directions in the words<br>
Where I am free<br>
Less weight high hopes to hop through the holes<br>
Another tree in another sea that has another dream but my gaze and look will make you believe <br>
That shadow you find in poem lives here underneath <br>
An animal inside is an animal outside <br>
So don’t know when or don’t know why<br>
An animal hides behind the glasses to look solved<br> 

Yup another tree in another sea that has another dream <br>
Half words half love<br>
Half smile but full life<br>

## 23

Careless mind is a drug<br>
It’s high on the nodes of darkness<br> 
You poke a bear and it stares you scream inside<br>
But the bear is empty to be killer or pet<br>
Careless mind is not a part of humanity<br>
It’s eyes staring not to be emphasised <br>
Can you hear it or not <br>
Can you feel it or not<br>
What’s real and what’s not real<br>
All illusion in the effect of drug<br>

## 24

All holdings are gone <br>
Awakening of concept <br>
Brings death to roses<br>
But what if it’s all mirage<br>
I’m finding my heart<br>
But eyes are colourblind<br> 
Tones are not speaking for themselves<br>
I am slave to them<br>
End your quotes cause<br>
They are just empty invocations<br>
Of feelings just like this one<br>

## 25

I dream you exist<br>
But my mind follows patterns to find you<br>
A mirage really<br>
Why memories exist backwards<br> 
And we live forward <br>
Are you part of me or illusion<br>
Lie may create you and let you exist<br>
You crave for truth with same filter of lie<br>
Who creates, who breaks,who lives,who dies<br>
If I tell you ,you exist and if you think I don’t<br> 
Then can this writing exist <br>
Existence is relative don’t you think?<br>
Please think<br>

## 26

Do you know what's alive and breathing ?<br>
My hopes to be with you <br>
Don't know what world thinks about theory of reality<br>
I feel this electrons displaying my poem for you, it means something real  <br>
