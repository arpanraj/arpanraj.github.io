A species which can be then developed as homo sapiens . His first creation of this species begin as fundamental level of living. So here I represent this world creation game series which starts as Evolution 0 : living. Join this journey to know how we developed in this new visionary way.


## Technical details of game

| Game engine | Unity |

| time: | two weeks |

## Goal of game

to create a new perspective in gamer and to create new way of game making.

## Why this game should exist?

	This game is not a typical game that follows gaming agendas.
	what gaming agendas?
		rewards,ways of making money out of game with more consumers
		rewards?
			Giving coins and play counts.These rewards drags you to spend more time into this games.You play this game not because of their unique design more often but to collect some coins which doesnt change your life or give you new perspective.
		ways of making money out of game with more consumers?
			Creating revenue by showing annoying ads which does not follow game's environment and making them click on them.
			Charging for getting ahead in game using in game currencies.
	This game wants you to change your perspective using gameplay and efforts to complete this game.
	how it can?
		I put thoughts in why and what of every thing in game.How visuals and music should feel with each other.How it should feel like finding new way.For example ,One of my friend playing this game thought that he is loosing in this game because of some other reason I never thought of,He was connecting dots to understand game.Same way we live and try to connect dots to making meaning but solutions are two way thing like when they follow the rules and when they dont follow the rules.
		(like video from vertesium 2 6 9 it follows my rule.)
		when you will complete this game ,I think you will understand whole concept of game.
	price of this game is also a way to check will you take risk just by watching video and screenshots.
	I think this can create revolution in game making which can lead to new way of thought process in game making.
	
## why Evolution 0 does not have start screen ?

	there is no start screen because I wanted player to be in the game as he starts game.I thought about following the concept of movies.There is companies' logo animations(like warner bros,marvel) at the start of movies but the sound of movies starts early with these logos.
		why?(can't they afford to waste time?)
			Well in my perspective, movies main objective is to make you feel that you are not watching a movie.You are right there at the movement.(Sometimes they break that too to make you feel in different way).So if you are already hearing sound it's normal in your perspective ok some sound is playing. Now, when you are hit with the view of movie.You are into that movement prograssing at speed connecting dots.Game of curiosity satisfied with view
			why they are creating curiosity?
				Suspence drives us.For example, see david fincher's girl with dragon tatoo.It is always trying to create question.These questions are answered in the next frame.
	what about start menu features?
		Basically there are features like mute game,quit game,start game etc.Now current phones doesnt need quit and mute game feature because they already have solution of home button and volume buttons.
	what about load on phone?
		Yeah,game is in 3d but the phones of current generation are more capable then you think.Ram storage and processor power is far more superior then my game's need.
		This game is also optimised and contains less 3d objects to manipulate.Â£d objects in game also loads when you are near them and looking at them as per camera vision in game.
